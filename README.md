# TestCaseOptimizer
Build a tool to upload existing test cases excel. It analyzes for duplicates, then I paste Jira stories one at a time and it tells meexactly what to change and what to add

# Test Case Optimization Tool

## Problem
Manual test case management leads to duplicate entries and inefficient execution.

## Solution
This tool analyzes uploaded Excel test cases, detects duplicates, and suggests improvements before Jira upload.

## Features
- Duplicate detection
- Smart suggestions
- Jira-ready output

## Tech Stack
- JavaScript
- Excel parsing

## Outcome
Reduces redundancy and improves test execution efficiency.

# Test Case Deduplication Tool

## 🔍 Problem
In large QA projects, duplicate test cases are common due to multiple testers and repeated uploads to tools like Jira/Xray.  
This leads to:
- Redundant execution
- Increased testing time
- Poor test coverage clarity

## 💡 Solution
This tool analyzes test cases from Excel and identifies duplicate or similar entries before they are uploaded.

## ⚙️ Features
- Detect exact duplicates
- Identify similar test cases (basic matching)
- Clean and optimized output
- Ready for Jira/Test Management tools

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- (Current) JavaScript / Excel processing  
- (Planned) Python + AI-based similarity detection

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- NLP-based similarity detection (AI)
- Integration with Jira APIs
- Web UI for uploading files
- Smart suggestions for merging test cases

## 📊 Impact
- Reduces redundancy in test suites
- Improves execution efficiency
- Helps QA teams maintain cleaner test repositories

## ▶️ How to Run (Python Version)

1. Install dependencies:
pip install pandas openpyxl

2. Run the script:
python dedup_tool.py

👉 This project is being extended into an AI-powered tool to detect semantic similarity between test cases using NLP models.
